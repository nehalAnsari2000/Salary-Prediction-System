Salary Prediction System 🚀
📌 Overview
This project is a machine learning model that predicts employee salaries based on years of experience using Linear Regression. It follows the full ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)
🔹 Features
✔ Loads and processes salary data from a CSV file 📊
✔ Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%)
✔ Uses Linear Regression to analyze salary trends
✔ Evaluates model accuracy using the R² score 📈
✔ Visualizes training data, test data, regression line, and predictions

📊 How It Works
1️⃣ Select a CSV file containing salary data.
2️⃣ The script reads the dataset and extracts Years of Experience (X) and Salary (Y).
3️⃣ Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
4️⃣ Trains a Linear Regression Model to establish a salary prediction pattern.
5️⃣ Predicts salaries for test data and evaluates accuracy using R² score.
6️⃣ Displays a graph with regression line and predictions.
